Task 0:
Objective: Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

Instructions:

Write a query using an INNER JOIN to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

Write a query using aLEFT JOIN to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

Write a query using a FULL OUTER JOIN to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

Task 1:
Objective: Write both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

Instructions:

Write a query to find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 using a subquery.

Write a correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

Task 2:
Objective: Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.

Instructions:

Write a query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.

Use a window function (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.

Task 3:
Objective: Identify and create indexes to improve query performance.

Instructions:

Identify high-usage columns in your User, Booking, and Property tables (e.g., columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY clauses).

Write SQL CREATE INDEX commands to create appropriate indexes for those columns and save them on database_index.sql

Measure the query performance before and after adding indexes using EXPLAIN or ANALYZE.

Task 4:
Objective: Refactor complex queries to improve performance.

Instructions:

Write an initial query that retrieves all bookings along with the user details, property details, and payment details and save it on perfomance.sql

Analyze the queryâ€™s performance using EXPLAIN and identify any inefficiencies.

Refactor the query to reduce execution time, such as reducing unnecessary joins or using indexing.

Task 5:
Objective: Implement table partitioning to optimize queries on large datasets.

Instructions:

Assume the Booking table is large and query performance is slow. Implement partitioning on the Booking table based on the start_date column. Save the query in a file partitioning.sql

Test the performance of queries on the partitioned table (e.g., fetching bookings by date range).

Write a brief report on the improvements you observed.
